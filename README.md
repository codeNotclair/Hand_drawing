# Hand_drawing
The Hand Gesture Drawing App is an innovative Python project that allows users to draw on a digital canvas using only their hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or stylus.
Python libraries used in this project are:
cv2
mediapipe
numpy
time
os
pickle
collections
How It Works
ðŸ”¹ The application uses a webcam to detect hand gestures in real-time.
ðŸ”¹ A computer vision model, such as MediaPipe Hands, tracks finger movements.
ðŸ”¹ The index finger acts as a drawing tool, while other gestures can be used to change colors, erase, or clear the canvas.
ðŸ”¹ The drawing is displayed on the screen, enabling a seamless and intuitive drawing experience.
